# SVG Icons used on LiveAgent, PostAffiliate and other QU websites

This repository is used as a source and central storage for icons used by LiveAgent (www.liveagent.com), PostAffiliate Pro (www.postaffiliatepro.com) and other websites managed by QU. 

All icons are saved in SVG format, preferably with outline paths (not strokes). Build file in a given project (ie. liveagent theme) will download them from this repository and build an SVG Sprite to be used in a project.
